Development work is in progress to support cmake instead of scons.

Cmake allows us to keep the source code, build, and 
install directories separate. 

The CMakeLists.txt files contain cmake directives.

These build instructions presume you are in the bash shell.

For purposes of illustration, we presume all work is being done
in /some/path/to/my/dir and that the framework externals 
are in /path/to/externals

cd /some/path/to/my/dir
svn co https://oink.fnal.gov/mu2e/trunk framework
mkdir build install
source /path/to/externals/setup
setup fw_externals v0_4_1 (choose the appropriate release)
source /some/path/to/my/dir/framework/bin/setup_fw.sh
cd /some/path/to/my/dir/build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/local/frame/install $FW_HOME
make
make install
