Key concepts of the art framework
=================================


Data-related
------------

* **Event Data Model**: Representation of the data that an experiment collects, all derived information, 
  and historical records necessary for reproduction of results.

* **Data Products**: Experiment defined classes that represent detector signals, reconstruction results,
  simulation, etc..

* **Event**: A collection of data products associated with one time window, the smallest
   unit of detector data collection to be processed.

* **SubRun**: A period of data collection in which operating conditions do not change.

* **Run**: A period of data collection, defined by the experiment.

* **Provenance**: Metadata describing how data products were produced.

Processing-related
------------------

* **Configuration**: Structured documents describing all processing aspects of a single job
  including setting of parameters and workflow specification.

* **Module**: An object (in C++) that â€œplugs into" a processing stream and performs a specific task on
  units of data obtained using the Event Data Model, independent of other running modules.

* **Event Processor**: An object that utilizes a configuration document to dynamically schedule sequences
  of modules to process data using the event data model.

* **Services**: A global facility that is dependent on the state of the application and that can
  be accessed from any module.

* **Process Name**: User-assigned name representing the kind of processing that a job is affiliated 
  with, such as reconstruction, testing, filtering.
