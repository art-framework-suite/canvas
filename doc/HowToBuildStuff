We are currently using scons (try 'man scons' on oink) to build stuff.

For each directory in which there is stuff to build, you have to:

  1. write a SConscript file in that directory (see below)
  2. make a new entry for that directory in the top-level SConstruct file.

= Writing SConscript files =

Look at FWCore/Version/src/SConscript for an example of how to build a
library from all the sources in a directory.

Look at FWCore/Version/test/SConscript for an example of how to build
tests that depend on some libraries.

= Running scons =

1. First make sure your environment is setup by sourcing bin/setup_mu2e.sh

2. To build everything, type
     scons -j 8
   This does an 8-way parallel build.

3. To build all the libraries, type
     scons tmp/lib
   Libraries will be createad in the tmp/lib directory.

4. To build all the tests, type
      scons tmp/test
   test executables will be created in the tmp/test directory.
