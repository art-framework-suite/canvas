mu2e currently (initial development stage) is not publicly available.
To get it (onto another system), you have to have:
    1) an account on oink.fnal.gov (to get tar file for mu2e externals (binaries))
and 2) svn access to https://oink.fnal.gov/mu2e/trunk

The mu2e externals on oink.fnal.gov are at:  /work/mu2e_externals

  cd /work
  tar czf mu2e_externals_v0.tgz mu2e_externals

copy this your system (64 bit modern/SLF5 linux system) via ftp,scp,??

On your system:
  cd work/dir
  # you could untar mu2e_externals here (resulting with mu2e_externals subdir)
  svn co https://oink.fnal.gov/mu2e/trunk mu2e
  cd mu2e
  . bin/setup_mu2e.sh   # possibly answering Q of where you have mu2e externals

Goto doc/HowToBuildStuff and return

Initial demo:
  mute FWCore/Services/test/tracer_cfg.py

The "usage" of the mute executable is:
   mute [options] [--parameter-set] config_file
You can see this via: mute --help
as you would be instructed to do if you just typed "mute" alone on a
command line.

More documentation about configuration can be found in doc/Configuration.txt
