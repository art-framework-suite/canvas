Notes on the use of FHiCL to configure framework executables
============================================================

The original version of the *art* framework executable was configured
using the Python configuration system inherited from CMS. We have
replaced that using FHiCL.

Below is a sample of how we propose to use FHiCL to configure the
framework executable. A real experiment would likely have some of
these values supplied by files that are #include'd into the
configuration file. Our example does not make any such use.

::

  # All of the "facility" configurations are optional;
  # the framework provides default settings that are used
  # if nothing is provided by the user.
  #
  message_facility: { ... } # lots of configurated, as required
                            # by the MessageFacility
  floating_point_control_facility: { ... }
  root_facility: { ... }
  trigger_names_facility: { ... }
  unix_signal_facility: { ... } 

  # Only one source is permitted
  source: { ... }

  analyzers: { 
    ... 
  }  
  
  filters: { ... }
  outputs: { ... }
  producers: { ... }

Historical Notes
================

CMS has *forced services* where we have *facilities*. 

The CMS *CurrentModuleService* has no configurable parameters, and
must be present. Because it has no parameters to configure, and
because it is always created, there is no reason for us to have a
"current_module_facility" configuration element in the configuration
file.
